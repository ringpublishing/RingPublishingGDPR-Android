1.4.0 Release notes (2021-05-19)
=============================================================

### Features

* Added support for backend configuration (based on geo-ip) for 'gdprApplies' (IABTCF_gdprApplies) flag. This flag can no longer be passed as parameter to the SDK initializer.
* Interaction with module on app start is now always asynchronous (where previously during first app launch it was synchronous).
SDK will always call one of two callback methods from interface 'RingPublishingGDPRShowConsentScreenListener' after set this listener:
    - 'onConsentsUpToDate()' if there is no need to show consents controller (for example gdprApplies is false, networking error during initialization, etc.)
    - 'onReadyToShowConsentScreen()' if consents controller should be presenter to the user (for example when gdprApplies is true and consents are not stored on the device or are
    outdated)

### Changes

* Removed 'gdprApplies' property from 'RingPublishingGDPR.getInstance().initialize()' method
* Removed 'shouldShowConsentForm()' method from 'RingPublishingGDPR' interface. Now at this point you should use 'setRingPublishingGDPRShowConsentScreenListener()' method.

### Fixes

* Fixed crash related to getFormView() and FormViewController
